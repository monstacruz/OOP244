1.) the operator  + must return a Fraction object and not a reference because it is not supposed to alter the left side of the equation.
2.) Fraction result in operator +
    Fraction result in operator *
    Fraction tmp in operator +=
3.) using isEmpty member function within the operator functions
    using the operator == in the operator != 
    using the operator + in the operator +=
    using the reduce function in some of the operators
4.) in this workshops I learned how to incorporate operators into a class and in a c++ program
